# NZ Devs Code of Conduct

This code of conduct, or appropriate variations of it, applies to the NZDevs Slack community
(http://nzdevs.slack.com).
As appropriate, it will include any events, projects, or future services provided by this community.

This was forked from the Devops NZ slack communities CoC,
which is based on the Geek Feminism community anti-harassment policy found here:
http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy,
and will be periodically updated to reflect any changes in the original version.
